##This names the job for the queueing system
#PBS -N simconfmarg

##This denotes the queue that the job should be run in.
#PBS -q flux

##This denotes the allocation within the queue
#PBS -A stats_flux

##Setting "quality of service" = flux appears to be required.
#PBS -l qos=flux

##This denotes the number of nodes and processors for the job.
#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=20
##For embarrassingly parallel computing, instead select
##the number of processors, sometimes adding one to run the
##master R process
##PBS -l procs=20,pmem=4gb

##This is the run time (hh:mm:ss) that your job will be allocated.
##It will be killed if it exceeds its walltime.
##Extreme over-estimation may slow your job in the queue.
#PBS -l walltime=02:00:00:00

##Import the shell's environment
##This is important if you're using Environment Modules
##(i.e. module load ...)
#PBS -V

##In what circumstances should an email be sent regarding this job?
##'a' is for aborted jobs,
##'b' is when the job starts,
##'e' is when the job exits.
#PBS -m abe

##Where should email be sent when the job starts and stops?
#PBS -M wdem@umich.edu

##Concatenates standard output and error messages.
##This is recommented at http://cac.engin.umich.edu/resources/software/pbs
#PBS -j oe

##code to be run

##   By default,
##   PBS scripts execute in your home directory, not the
##   directory from which they were submitted. The following
##   line places you in the directory from which the job
##   was submitted.
##
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

##module load R
